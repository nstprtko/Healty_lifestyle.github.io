    <h1>Healthy lifestyle</h1>
    <h2>Nourishment for the Body</h2>
    <p>A healthy lifestyle starts with a balanced diet that provides essential nutrients. Incorporating a variety of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats can enhance overall well-being. Reducing processed foods and added sugars helps maintain energy levels and supports long-term health.
        For example, a Mediterranean diet, rich in olive oil, nuts, and fresh produce, is linked to lower risks of chronic diseases. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is also crucial for maintaining metabolic functions and improving skin health.
     </p><br>

    <h2>The Power of Physical Activity</h2>
    <p>Regular physical exercise is a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle.
        Engaging in activities like walking, cycling, or strength training for at least 150 minutes per week can boost cardiovascular health, improve mood, and increase energy levels. Exercise not only enhances physical fitness but also stimulates mental well-being by releasing endorphins, often referred to as "feel-good" hormones.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Rest and Mental Wellness</h2>
    <p>Equally important to diet and exercise is prioritizing sleep and mental health. Adults generally need 7â€“9 hours of quality sleep each night to allow the body to recover and function optimally. 
        Practices like mindfulness, meditation, and stress management can reduce anxiety and improve focus.
         Building a support system through relationships and hobbies can further enhance emotional well-being.
          When all aspects of physical and mental health align, individuals can experience a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
